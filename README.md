Stock market forecasting is inherently complex due to its nonlinearity and volatility, making it challenging for traditional time series and machine learning techniques to achieve satisfactory results. To address this issue and enhance prediction accuracy, we propose a hybrid approach that combines wavelet transformation with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. This methodology is applied to historical stock prices from the 20 most relevant companies on the IBOVESPA index. The wavelet transformation decomposes the stock data into multiple components, capturing both high and low-frequency information. These components are then used as inputs for the LSTM network, which is adept at handling sequential data.The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) metric. The empirical results suggest that while the wavelet-LSTM model offers some improvement in forecasting accuracy, it does not significantly enhance prediction performance to be a functional tool. This indicates that while wavelet transformation can enhance LSTM's ability to process financial time series data, the overall gains in prediction accuracy are modest. Further exploration of additional techniques to achieve more substantial improvements in forecasting non-stationary and nonlinear financial time series data is necessary to develop a useful market prediction tool.
